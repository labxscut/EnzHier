# EnzHier

EnzHier is a tool that uses deep learning to classify protein sequences into enzyme categories.

## Overview

EnzHier utilizes protein sequence embedding vectors generated by ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) and neural network architecture to predict enzyme classification. This tool analyzes protein sequences provided in FASTA format and predicts their Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers.
