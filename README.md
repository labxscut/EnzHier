# EnzHier

EnzHier is a tool for enzyme classification from protein sequences using deep learning.

## Overview

EnzHier uses protein sequence embeddings generated by ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) and a neural network architecture to predict enzyme classifications. The tool analyzes protein sequences provided in FASTA format and predicts their enzyme commission (EC) numbers.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- PyTorch
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- CLEAN (Custom library for enzyme classification)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd EnzHier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run EnzHier on your protein sequences:

```bash
python app/web_EnzHier/EnzHier_infer_fasta_new.py -d <fasta_file>
```

Where `<fasta_file>` is the name of your FASTA file (without the .fasta extension) located in the `data/inputs/` directory.

## Input

- The input should be a FASTA format file containing one or more protein sequences.
- Place your FASTA file in the `data/inputs/` directory.

## Output

- Results are stored in the `results/` directory.
- The output includes EC number predictions along with confidence scores.

## Model

EnzHier uses a pre-trained neural network model (LayerNormNet) that has been trained on enzyme sequences. The model processes ESM embeddings of protein sequences and compares them to known enzyme classifications.
