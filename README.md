# EnzHier

EnzHier is a tool that uses deep learning to classify enzymes from protein sequences.

## Overview

EnzHier uses protein sequence embeddings generated by ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) and a neural network architecture to predict enzyme classifications. The tool analyzes protein sequences provided in FASTA format and predicts their Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers.
